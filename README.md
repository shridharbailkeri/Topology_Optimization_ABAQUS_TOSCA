# Topology_Optimization_ABAQUS_TOSCA_AND_OPTISTRUCT_DECK
Topology optimization of simple 2D and 3D parts (simplified to achieve quick run).
Objective_Function: minimize strain energy,
design constraint: Volume (0.3Vo and 0.6Vo for 2D and 3D part respectively).
Under static load and constraints on opposite edges of the plates.
Number of cycles - 25
