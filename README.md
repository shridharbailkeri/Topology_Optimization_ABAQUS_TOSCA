# Topology_Optimization_ABAQUS_TOSCA
Topology optimization for simple 2D and 3D parts (simplified to achieve quick run).
Objective_Function: minimize strain energy.
Constraint: 0.3Vo and 0.6Vo for 2D and 3D part respectively.
Under static load and constraints on opposite sides of the part.
Number of cycles - 25
